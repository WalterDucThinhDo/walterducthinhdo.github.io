# Duc Thinh Doâ€™s Porfolio

I am a double major student, and I expect to graduate in 2025 or 2026.

## My top favorite lab in CPSC_120L

Top 3: Lab_8 Part 2

To be honest, this lab is my favorite to work with because I can imagine it like a game. It gives me an opportunity to be familiar with the FOR loop. However, that lab gives the challenge to understand. It took me a while to make it pass. Without the help from the SI course, I could be stuck with its forever.

Top 2: Lab_5 Both Part

I am getting familiar with coding because lab_5 is the key that brings me to do the coding. This lab helps me to get familiar with If-condition coding, string, variables, and data type. However, it took me some time to learn and memorize those terms.

Top 1: Lab_9 Both Part

I really interested in this lab, and it is super useful for me to enjoy the lab. Obviously, I can be familiar with every terms that we have learned in class lecture and reading materials. However, I must practice more if I want to be familiar with it.

### Conclusion

Some labs might have pros and cons, but I believe that everything we are doing is useful for us in future coding jobs
